  I am a second year CE/EE major who is still looking for my passion within the field, 
  and so during my studies I'm focusing on a breadth of knowledge approach. 
  Outside of engineering, I enjoy playing saxophone and guitar, picking up a board game, 
  occasionally dabbling in photography, and visiting family in India. 
  I hope that by the end of my time in at NEU I can look back and 
  say that I've had a positive impact; whether it is for my peers, community, or organizations.
