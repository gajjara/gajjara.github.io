  I am a second year Computer and Electrical Engineering major, with a CS minor at Northeastern; 
  to obtain a breadth of knowledge in computing and electronics systems.
  
  Outside of engineering, I play the guitar and saxophone, take out my camera here and then, 
  occasionally picking up a board game, out on a walk, or in India.
  
  I hope that through my experiences and engineering skills that I can make some form of positive impact.
