  I am a second year Computer and Electrical Engineering major, with a goal
  to obtain a breadth of knowledge in computing and electronics systems.
  
  I play the guitar and saxophone, take out my camera now and then, 
  occasionally pick up a board game, or visit family in India.
  
  I hope that through my experience that I can make some form of positive impact.
