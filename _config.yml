  I am Anuj Gajjar, a second year Computer and Electrical Engineering major, with a Computer Science minor at Northeastern; 
  currently trying to obtain a breadth of knowledge in computing and electronics systems.
  
  Outside of engineering, I have played the guitar and saxophone for 10 years, I enjoy taking out my camera here and then, 
  occasionally play a board game, go out on a walk here and then, love BoJack Horseman, or may be in India.
  
  I hope that through my experiences and engineering skills that I am able to make some form of positive impact, 
  wheter or not it is internal in an organization, within STEM communities, or improves someone's life.
