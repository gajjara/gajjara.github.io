## MagicMirror: My Basic Personal Assistant 

**Back Story:** 
On GitHub I found a repository called <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/"> MagicMirror</a>, which is a "open source modular smart mirror platform. With a growing list of installable modules, the MagicMirrorÂ² allows you to convert your hallway or bathroom mirror into your personal assistant." For a rather simple project, I thought I could modify some of the source code to show my daily schedule, the weather, and the news.

### The Result

After adjusting some of the javascript and CSS files in my copy of the MagicMirror repository, I was succesfully able to launch my version of the repository.

I added and adjusted modules to show the current time, my calendar, the current weather, the weather forcast, the current music I'm playing, and the news.

I also installed my version of the repository on a Raspberry Pi.
