**Goal:** Develop an enhanced prototype of a wireless charging platform for drones/UAVs.

**Back Story:**

Our client came to Generate Product Development with the idea of creating a refined prototype of a wireless charging platform for drones/UAVs, as there is a need for drones to be rapidly recharged in scenarios where wall power is not readily avaliable (for example, fire rescue operations). Our deliverables for this product was to:

- Develop an enclosure for the wireless charging platform
- Develop a way to fold the enclosure in order for the platform to be carried by a user
- Integrate a set of batteries within the system in order for the system to provide power to the wireless charging system
- Build battery and power management PCBs for the batteries and wireless charging system

My role on this project involved the battery and power management PCBs.

**Summary:**

Overall this project was this still left in the early stages of the product development cycle. A significant amount of work could not be tested (in integration) due to having to go remote in the middle of the project. Nonetheless a remotely-designed prototype was made of the mechanical enclosure and battery/power management systems. Battery and power management PCBs were created with the use of Analog Device ICs and tested through simulation of the ICs and electrical system.
