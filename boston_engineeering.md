# Positive Energy

* Client came in with a prototype for a generator that harnesses walking movement
  * Feasibility was questionable
  * Client’s idea: place prototype in pocket
* I was tasked with testing the device for a feasibility assessment
  * Created test setup with Arduino and servo
  * Tested performance with existing circuit and resistive loads
  * Added some analysis about the feasibility of the device

# SharkNinja

MATLAB modeling of a cleaning pad for SharkNinja

Used the modeling to see the kinematics of the pad\, and to tie it into the cleaning rate of a specific pad material

Doing some mustard stain testing for the modeling

Still wrapping up the project

# Take Aways

Experience\!

Engineering at this level takes time

Communication/Documentation

Survived I\-90

Still could work on:

Time management

Being more proactive about asking for help
